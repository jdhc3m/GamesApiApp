# GamesApiApp

This is a app that use IGBD Api to load Game Data

Third Part Libraries 

Json -> It was used to treat the data/Object from Json Array 

Card View -> It Was used to show the image nicely
Picasso -> It Was used to load the image from the Url
RecyclerView -> It was used to setup the list

Things That I would change if I have more time:
  Use RxJava and Retrofit, I decided to use Simple Json for the reason of the documentation of IGBD is on that model.
